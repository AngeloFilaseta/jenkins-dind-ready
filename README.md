# jenkins-dind-ready

## Motivations 
When it comes to Docker, [Jenkins documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/) states:


> There are several Docker images of Jenkins available.  
> Use the recommended official jenkins/jenkins image from the Docker Hub repository. This image contains the current Long-Term Support (LTS) release of Jenkins, which is production-ready. However, this image doesnâ€™t contain Docker CLI, and is not bundled with the frequently used Blue Ocean plugins and its features. To use the full power of Jenkins and Docker, you may want to go through the installation process described below.

This repository purpose is to reduce the process of downloading and running Jenkins in Docker
(while still having access to a [DinD](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) daemon) to a single command.

## Executing
1. Starts all containers using the following command. `-d` means that the containers run in the background, not locking the terminal from where the command was executed.
```shell
docker compose up --profile service
```

2. Enter http://localhost:8080/ and proceed like you would normally do in a plain Jenkins installation.

## Configuring an Agent

1. To configure an Agent on Jenkins, navigate to `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Nodes and Clouds` > `New Node`. In the
   creation step don't use SSH.

2. After setting up the agent, it won't be connected. Click on the name of the new agent marked with an X and look for
   the command proposed for connection.

3. On the machine where the agent must be placed execute, pull this repo, fill the `.env` file with the information
   found in the previous command and finally execute the following command:
```shell
docker compose up --profile agent
```

**_NOTE:_**  The agent can also use a docker daemon. It is configured to use the system daemon for now.
